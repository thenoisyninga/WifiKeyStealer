# Wifi Key Stealer
A basic python script that scans and records wifi passwords on a windows computer and then writes them to a file.
As of now, it completely bypasses windows defender. 

## Usage
Best use case is to have it on a removavble drive, run the executable and wait about 5 to 10 seconds for a new file to appear in the same directory as the executable, then plug it out.

This generated file can be open via any text editor to see a list of Wifi SSIDs and their keys
